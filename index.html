            <p>Blockchain is a public, digital ledger which tracks real-time movements and transactions of assets. Each transaction is a single “block”, and each block links together to form a “chain” known as a “blockchain”. Encrypted data in the blocks are linked with one another permanently. A blockchain is a decentralized database that keeps a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks. It records transactions of multiple computers, which record cannot be altered retroactively without modifying all corresponding subsequent blocks and networks. Each transaction is visible to participants within the network. It creates the audit history of each transaction and keeps records and reviews. When new data is added to the network, it is required to verify the legitimacy of the data according to the economic incentives or authority of the majority of nodes. This process is named the consensus mechanism. Cryptographic techniques secure the data in the blockchain, which makes it complicated to tamper with. Once the consensus is obtained, a new block will be created along the chain. All nodes will thereby be updated.</p>

            <div id="Showmore">
                <h3>How Blockchain Works?</h3>
                <p>Blockchain begins with the data exchanged between two parties in the form of money, deeds, contracts, customer details, medical records, or any other asset in digital form. Verification is required. The duration of the step taken will depend on the network’s parameters, which will be undertaken instantly or transcribed into secured records and pending transactions in the queue. The computers or servers in the network will then determine the transaction's validity according to the network rules.</p>
                <p>A block contains a header referencing the previous block’s hash and the transactions. A hash contains 8 bytes using the algorithm agreed upon by the network. The linked hash provides security and interdependency of the chain. Before adding to form the block in the blockchain, it must be first validated. One of the methods is through proof consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work / Proof of Stake), solving the mathematical puzzle from the block’s header. Miners make extra changes to a variable to solve the blocks until it satisfies the requirements of the entire network; this is named “proof of work”. If someone maliciously attempts to manipulate the block and submit to the chain, the hash function will change to defence. The other nodes will then reject the block from entering the major chain in order to prevent corruption.</p>
                <p>When the block is verified, the block is distributed to the entire network. The miner will be rewarded. Each node adds the corresponding node to the majority chain.</p>

            <h2>Uses of Blockchain: Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <h3>Example: Bitcoin</h3>
            <p>The design of Bitcoin is multifunctional, Bitcoin stores value and plays a role of medium of exchange. With the technology of Blockchain, Bitcoin can bypass numerous restrictions from traditional financial intermediaries, and also secures the privacy and safety of transaction by not using distributed network which can be accessed by other parties.</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>It is pretty much just like how the blockchain work!!
            </p>
            <p>First of all, user need to have a cryptowallet which provides the power for user to trade and store Bitcoin. It is a private address which other parties can send user Bitcoin, but at the same time it requires user to authorise the transaction. </p>
            <p>After user wallet is all set, users may transact Bitcoin to each other's wallet addresses by specifying receiver's address and the amount that sender want to send.</p>
            <p>Then, the sender can authorise the transaction by digital signing through their cryptowallet.</p>
            <p>Now, the authorised order, which is sent to Bitcoin network, is awaiting the miners to verify the validation of the transaction, confirm the transaction is authorised, and also make sure sender has sufficient UTXOs(Unspent Transaction Outputs, aka sufficient remaining in user's wallet) to be spent on the transaction.</p>
            <p>Assume it is verified, the transaction would be sent into mempool, which is a waiting area for valid transaction. The first miner who solves a cryptographic puzzle(Proof-Of-Work) to add the new block into the blockchain. </p>
            <p>Right after it is in the blockchain, the transaction is required more confirmations from new added subsequent blocks, in order to enhance the safety of the transaction.</p>

            <h2>Uses of Blockchain: Banking & Finance</h2>
            <h3>Example: KINEXYS by J.P. Morgan (aka JPM Coin)</h3>
            <h3>What is KINEXYS?</h3>
            <p>Kinexys Digital Payments is a solution that allows payment and deposit by applying blockchain system. It gets rid of traditional treasury friction points - like currency barrier(e.g. exchange rate), and time constraints(e.g. non-office hours), to achieve instant, 24/7, cross-border transaction for institutional clients worldwide. </p>
            <h3>Integrate with Blockchain technology</h3>
            <p>KINEXYS uses Tokenized Collateral Network(TCN) which use JPM Coin on permissioned blockchain to represent tokenised assets. Corporations can convert their fiat currency(e.g. USD,GBP) into digital tokens for blockchained-based transactions, for instance, cross-border payments, worldwide capital management, flexible risk mitigation, etc. </p>
            <h3>Instant Cross-Border Payments</h3>
            <p>Global Corporation can pay their expenses from different countries or districts via KINEXYS. For example to pay their numerous suppliers, subsidiaries from worldwide by converting their currency into JPM Coin(digital token) on KINEXYS. Then immediate send their capital to target receiver who can receive it within milliseconds and can convert the tokens into fiat currency right after. This enhances the efficiency and speed of the transaction, allowing both parties to have a better cash flow and operational agility.</p>
            <h3>Worldwide Capital Management & Risk Mitigation</h3>
            <p>Same logic as previous paragraph, it helps corporate centralise or decentralise the capital by moving their cash, capital, fund freely and instantly. It bypasses the regulations, barriers and constraints from different border, including interest rate fluctuation, exchange rate fluctuation, or any political uncertainty. Therefore, it allows a safety, riskless and high efficiency for corporate operation, capital management and against the risk proactively. </p>

            <h2>Uses of Blockchain: Smart Contract</h2>
            <h3>What is Smart Contract?</h3>
            <p>Smart Contract is a combination of self-executing program and digital agreement which automatically write into code only in a blockchain, without any legal language, terms, or agreements. The actions between two parties would be automated by the script of smart contract. With the blockchain feature of decentralised, it operates without any intermediaries, for instance legal authority, or any financial institution. Also, it provides trustworthy and reliable transaction as safety as cryptocurrency because there is no middleman involved. </p>
            <h3>How it works?</h3>
            <p>Similar to any blockchain technology!!</p>
            <p>First, the agreement between both parties has to be reached. Then the terms of the contract would be translated into a logic in coding script which coded by themselves or developer. For instance, "Pay $500 if water usage exceeds 500L" convert to "if water > 500, transfer payment".</p>
            <p>After the contract is ready, it would be uploaded to a blockchain which has unique cryptographic like cryptocurrency, and the contract would be sent to every node in the network. </p>
            <p>Once the condition is met (detected by sensor, and uploaded to the network), the contract would be automatically activated. Several actions would be performed automatically by smart contract, for instance, automatically transfer $500 to receiver account once the sender used over 500L of water. The execution would be instantly uploaded to the blockchain, and it would be verified by the blockchain network. As a result, it would be record as transaction and the completed smart contract would be stored on the blockchain which allows both parties to check it at anytime.</p>

            <h2>Uses of Blockchain: Health Care</h2>
            <h3>Why Blockchain in Health Care</h3>
            <p>With the safety feature of blockchain, it protects the sensitive data from any illegal act and hacking attack, ensuring patient's or any stakeholder's privacy and safety. In details, in blockchain, individual block relies on the previous block to maintain continuity, and because of the ledger is public, any changes are needed to be verified so any suspicious action would be immediately noticed.</p>
            <h2>Blockchain in Healthcare</h2>
            <h3>Medical Data</h3>
            <p>Patient records and data are encrypted and stored in every node in the network, it avoids the risk of single point failure and ensure the data are accurate and safe. In addition, blockchain allows doctors or medical staff transfer patient data instantly when the patient need to visit several doctors to ensure treatment efficiency and accuracy. </p>
            <h3>Insurance information</h3>
            <p>By addressing blockchain technology, medical staff and insurance company can access the latest and up-to-date information of patients, or even access the historical medical record of the patient as well. It allows all parties to avoid any fraud from individuals faking medical conditions and records. Moreover, by addressing smart contract, it can automate insurance claims verification and procedure. Once the condition is met, the claims payment would be automatically transfer to patient's account, allowing patient to get the remedies for treatment immediately and enjoy a better recover timing by reducing the processing time of the claim. </p>

            <h2>Bitcoin Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Consensus Mechanism: <span class="highlight">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</span></h3>
            <p>Miners are required to find a random number that makes the hash have a leading number of zeros, to finish the <span class="highlight">crypto-puzzle</span>. The complexity of the puzzle is adjusted every 2 weeks to maintain the <span class="highlight">block time</span> around 10 minutes (Nakamoto, n.d.). This difficulty adjustment ensures consistent block creation, preventing any single entity from dominating the process (Nadcab Labs, n.d.). Miners compete using computational power, solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and earn rewards. This decentralized mechanism secures the network, making it resistant to attacks and ensuring no individual can control the network.</p>

            <h3>Transaction Speed and Scalability</h3>
            <p>Transactions are grouped into blocks added every ~10 minutes. <span class="highlight">Merkle Trees</span> compress transactions into a single root hash to save storage. However, Bitcoin processes only approximately <span class="highlight">7 transactions per second</span>, which is relatively slow (How Bitcoin Can Scale | River Learn - Bitcoin Basics, n.d.). This limited throughput stems from Bitcoin’s 1MB block size cap, prioritizing security and decentralization over speed (Bitstamp, n.d.). Miners validate transactions, bundling them into blocks, with <span class="highlight">Merkle Trees</span> enabling efficient verification and data integrity (Admin, 2024). Scalability solutions like the <span class="highlight">Lightning Network</span> aim to increase transaction capacity by processing off-chain payments, preserving Bitcoin’s core principles.</p>

            <h3>Privacy and Anonymity</h3>
            <p>When executing a transaction, users employ different random-looking (i.e., one-time) <span class="highlight">pseudonymous public keys</span> (i.e., addresses) to protect their privacy. Privacy is protected due to the randomness as long as the addresses remain unlinked to the user’s identity (Buczak, 2024). Bitcoin’s design avoids storing personal data on the blockchain, enhancing anonymity. However, blockchain analysis can sometimes link addresses to identities if users are careless, such as reusing addresses or transacting through centralized exchanges. Tools like <span class="highlight">CoinJoin</span> and mixers further obscure transaction trails, bolstering privacy while maintaining Bitcoin’s decentralized nature (Antonopoulos, 2017).</p>

            <h3>Smart Contracts and Programmability</h3>
            <p>Only simple scripting rules are applied, such as unlocking transactions based on the specific date (Script - Bitcoin Wiki, n.d.). The complexity of the <span class="highlight">scripting language</span> is not as high as in other cryptocurrencies, hence, building complex applications like NFTs is not feasible. Bitcoin’s <span class="highlight">scripting language</span> prioritizes security and simplicity, limiting programmability to basic conditions like multisignature transactions or timelocks. Unlike Ethereum, which supports Turing-complete contracts, Bitcoin’s conservative approach reduces attack surfaces. Proposals like <span class="highlight">Taproot</span> enhance scripting flexibility for efficiency without compromising reliability (Nadcab Labs, n.d.-a).</p>

            <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Since <span class="highlight">Proof-of-Work (PoW)</span> is used, it requires consuming massive amounts of electricity for mining (Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index: CBECI, n.d.). Although energy consumption is high, security is ensured. This issue might be mitigated by using renewable energy. Bitcoin’s <span class="highlight">Proof-of-Work</span> demands significant computational power, driving high electricity usage to secure the network against attacks. The 2024 CoinShares report highlights that miners are increasingly relocating to regions with cheaper, often renewable-heavy energy sources, like hydropower or solar, to optimize costs. Efficiency improvements in mining hardware also reduce energy intensity, balancing security with sustainability efforts (CoinShares Mining Report 2024, n.d.).</p>

            <h2>Ethereum Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Consensus Mechanism: Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</h3>
            <p>PoS is a mechanism used by Ethereum to validate transactions and create new blocks without relying on PoW. Validators are chosen to propose and attest to new blocks via a random selection algorithm, weighted by the amount of ETH staked and time since the last selection (Proof-of-stake (POS), n.d.). Other validators verify the blocks and vote. A block becomes irreversible once confirmed.</p>
            <h3>Transaction Speed and Scalability</h3>
            <p>ETH uses sharding and rollups to increase transaction speed. Data Sharding divides Ethereum’s blockchain into smaller parallel shards. Rollups process transactions off-chain, bundle them, compress the data onto Ethereum, and provide validity proofs for verification. Ethereum’s transaction speed targets to reach around 100,000 transactions per second, but currently the TPS stays at 173.6 (Sergeenkov, 2024).</p>
            <h3>Privacy and Anonymity</h3>
            <p>ETH uses zk-SNARKs, Tornado Cash, and Stealth Addresses to provide a trustworthy system (Brown, 2024). Zk-SNARKs and Tornado Cash can be used together to hide transaction details. Zk-SNARKs generates a new encrypted address to prove ownership without leaking personal information, while Tornado Cash acts as a decentralized mixer to enhance privacy.</p>
            <h3>Smart Contracts and Programmability</h3>
            <p>ETH utilizes Turing-complete smart contracts, which are compiled into EVM bytecode and auto-execute when conditions are met (Team, 2024). These contracts run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM supports loops, conditional logic, and complex computations, making its programmability highly flexible.</p>
            <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Due to the adoption of PoS, validators secure the network by staking ETH, not by solving complex crypto-puzzles, reducing energy consumption by 99.95% (How Does Ethereum Work? An Introduction to ETH, n.d.). However, some argue that staking centralizes power among those with more ETH.</p>

            <h2>USDT Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Consensus Mechanism: Depends on the <span class="highlight">host chain</span></h3>
            <p>USDT itself is not a standalone blockchain; its consensus mechanism depends on the <span class="highlight">host chain</span>. For example, ERC-20 USDT uses <span class="highlight">PoS</span>, TRC-20 USDT uses <span class="highlight">DPoS</span>, and the original USDT uses <span class="highlight">PoW</span>. Thus, security varies. Each <span class="highlight">host chain</span>’s consensus governs transaction validation. Ethereum’s <span class="highlight">PoS</span> ensures validator-driven security, while Tron’s <span class="highlight">DPoS</span> uses elected delegates for faster consensus. Bitcoin’s <span class="highlight">PoW</span>, used by Omni USDT, relies on mining, offering robust but slower security. This diversity lets USDT adapt to different blockchain strengths (Ledger, 2023).</p>

            <h3>Transaction Speed and Scalability</h3>
            <p>Since USDT’s consensus mechanism relies on the <span class="highlight">host chain</span>, transaction speed and scalability vary. For instance, it is slower on ERC-20 USDT (<span class="highlight">173.6 TPS</span>) than on SPL-based chains (<span class="highlight">65,000 TPS</span>) (Ledger, 2025). Solana’s high-throughput design enables fast USDT transfers. Tron’s TRC-20 supports up to 2,000 TPS with low fees, ideal for payments. Ethereum’s ERC-20 faces congestion, slowing transactions. These differences let users choose chains based on speed and cost needs (CoinShares Mining Report 2024, n.d.-b).</p>

            <h3>Privacy and Anonymity</h3>
            <p>USDT records transactions on <span class="highlight">transparent ledgers</span>, allowing anyone to trace them. While different blockchains offer varying privacy systems (e.g., pseudonymous addresses, mixers, decentralized exchanges), USDT’s privacy remains very low due to traceability. Public blockchains expose transaction details, risking user identification. Tools like mixers can obscure trails, but they face regulatory issues. Centralized exchanges often require <span class="highlight">KYC</span>, reducing anonymity. Privacy-focused chains offer limited shielding for USDT users, making full anonymity hard.</p>

            <h3>Smart Contracts and Programmability</h3>
            <p>USDT itself is not programmable and is compatible with the <span class="highlight">host chain</span>’s apps. It lacks built-in smart contracts. However, it follows the <span class="highlight">host chain</span>’s <span class="highlight">smart contract rules</span>. Despite not being programmable, USDT is often integrated into programmable ecosystems. Ethereum’s <span class="highlight">EVM</span> supports DeFi apps using ERC-20 USDT for trading and lending. Tron’s TRC-20 works with dApps for payments. This integration makes USDT versatile in DeFi, despite no native programmability (Anglen, 2024).</p>

            <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Since USDT’s consensus mechanism relies on the <span class="highlight">host chain</span>, energy efficiency varies by blockchain. For example, it consumes less energy on <span class="highlight">PoS</span> chains (e.g., ERC-20) and more on <span class="highlight">PoW</span> chains (e.g., Bitcoin/original USDT). Its eco-friendliness depends on the underlying blockchain. Ethereum’s <span class="highlight">PoS</span> cuts energy use sharply. Tron’s <span class="highlight">DPoS</span> is also lightweight. Bitcoin’s <span class="highlight">PoW</span> demands high electricity for mining, impacting Omni USDT. Users can pick <span class="highlight">greener chains</span> for better efficiency (Cambridge Blockchain Network Sustainability Index: CBECI, n.d.-b).</p>

            <h2>Advantages of Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Decentralization</span>: Blockchain distributes decision-making and data storage across a network of participants instead of storing in a single centralized authority. Reducing the risk of single points of failure and censorship and making the whole system more resilient. Decentralization relies on the network consensus and shared ledger to validate transactions. The real-time and shared view of data to all parties reduces errors and inconsistencies.</li>
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CS1102groupproject/CS1102_Project/main/benefits%20of%20blockchain.png" alt="Benefits of Blockchain" style="max-width: 10%; height: auto;">
                <li><span class="dark-red">Transparency</span>: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which is visible and verifiable by all participants. This enhances trust among users and stakeholders as each transaction can be traced and audited. For example: the blockchain is used to trace funds in real time, this ensures that aid reaches intended beneficiaries and reduces the possibility of fraud.</li>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Security</span>: The application of advanced cryptographic techniques has enhanced security by encrypting and linking through cryptographic hashes. Hashing transforms data into a unique list of strings; it will be changed if the input is modified. This makes it difficult to alter any recorded data without being detected, further enhancing security.</li>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Immutability</span>: Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed or deleted. This immutability is ensured by cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which link blocks in a chain. Any attempt to alter will make tampering evident and rejected by the network. This immutability ensures data integrity and accuracy.</li>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Efficiency</span>: Blockchain can streamline processes as it eliminates intermediaries and automates transactions with smart contracts. This results in less delay, lower transaction fees, and minimizes human errors. For example, it enables faster settlement and real-time tracking in supply chain management, increasing operational effectiveness and cutting costs.</li>

            <h2>Disadvantages of Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Scalability</span>: Managing large transaction volumes is challenging for many blockchain networks. Throughput is limited by traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which need each node to validate and retain every transaction. Compared to centralized systems like Visa, which can process hundreds of transactions per second, Bitcoin handles just 7–10 transactions per second. During peak hours, this scalability problem causes network congestion, delayed transaction confirmations, and increased costs.</li>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Energy Consumption</span>: Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains use much electricity because mining requires a lot of processing power. One transaction requires as much electricity as the typical US household uses in over two months. Environmental concerns are raised from the problem of high energy usage, which has also led to governmental scrutiny and, in certain places, crypto mining moratoriums. A more energy-efficient substitute is provided by Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, which significantly lower the amount of power used for each transaction.</li>

                <li><span class="dark-red">Complexity</span>: The implementation and maintenance of blockchain technology requires specific technical expertise due to its complexity. It is difficult for developers and consumers who are not familiar with the technology to use. Its complexity makes it harder for wider adoption. Mistakes and inefficiencies may result from inappropriate handling. Continuous efforts are being made to streamline blockchain interfaces and offer educational materials, which lessen these difficulties.</li>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Regulatory Uncertainty</span>: Blockchain's legal and regulatory landscape is still developing and differs greatly between nations. Many nations lack clear regulations. Regulatory challenges in emerging economies can hinder adoption and raise compliance costs. These obstacles include inconsistent laws, inadequate infrastructure, and security concerns. While a lack of regulation might put consumers at risk, too onerous or unclear restrictions may hinder innovation. To strike a balance between control and innovation, regulatory frameworks must be unified and flexible.</li>
                <li><span class="dark-red">Cost</span>: During periods of network congestion, blockchain transaction fees can rise significantly due to limited block sizes and slower processing times, forcing users to pay higher fees to prioritize their transactions. This makes blockchain less practical for small or frequent payments and hinders its scalability as a payment solution. The analysis draws on expert insights and case studies to outline both the benefits and challenges of blockchain technology, reflecting its current state and ongoing advancements.</li>
